# Decisions - Case Statement
#
# This simple program shows how to make slightly more complex decisions in your code that involve
# more than one path based on a single variable. 
#

# The Main Program Starts Here
Main
	#Set a variable to a value
	myNumber = 3
	
	# a simple case example selecting text output based on the value of myNumber
	case of myNumber
		0: print "It's Zero"
		1: print "It's One"
		2: print "It's Two"
		3: print "It's Three"
		4: print "It's Four"
		5: print "It's Five"
		other: print "Something Else"
	endcase
