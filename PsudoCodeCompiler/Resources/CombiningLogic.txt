# Combining Logic
#
# This example demonstrates the syntax for combining logical statements using the Boolean
# logic operations of AND, OR and NOT. 
#

# The Main Program Starts Here
Main
	# Set the number variable to an arbitrary value
	# Change these to anything to test how the code works
	rating = "R"
	customerAge = 21
	
	# statements can be combined on one line
	if rating == "R" AND customerAge < 18 then
		print "Too Young for R Rated Movies"
		
	# or statements can span multiple lines
	elseif rating == "PG-13" 
	AND customerAge < 13 then
		print "Must Have Parent for PG-13 Rated Movies"
	else
		print "Sell Approved"
	endif
