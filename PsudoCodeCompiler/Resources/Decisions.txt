# Decisions - If / Then / Else 
#
# This simple program shows how to make simple logical decisions in your code based on
# value comparisons of two variables. In any of these structures variables may be replaced
# with literals if required.
#

# The Main Program Starts Here
Main
	# Set the number variable to an arbitrary value
	# Change these to anything to test how the code works
	number = 5
	other = 5
	
	# compare equality
	if number == 5 then
		print number, "is equal to", other
	else
		print number, "is not equal to", other
	endif
	
	# compare inequality
	if number != 5 then
		print number, "is not equal to", other
	else
		print number, "is equal to", other
	endif
	
	# another inequality comparison, equivalent to above
	if number <> 5 then
		print number, "is not equal to", other
	else
		print number, "is equal to", other
	endif
	
	# greater than
	if number > 5 then
		print number, "is greater than", other
	else
		print number, "is not greater than", other
	endif
	
	# greater than or equal
	if number >= 5 then
		print number, "is greater than or equal to", other
	else
		print number, "is not greater than or equal to", other
	endif
	
	# less than
	if number < 5 then
		print number, "is less than", other
	else
		print number, "is not less than", other
	endif
	
	# less than or equal
	if number <= 5 then
		print number, "is less than or equal to", other
	else
		print number, "is not less than or equal to", other
	endif
