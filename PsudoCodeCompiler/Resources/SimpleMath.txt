	set number to 1
	total = 10
	print "Starting Values: ", number, total
	
	add number to total
	number = number + 2
	print "After Adding Values: ", number, total
	
	subtract number from total
	number = number - 1
	print "After Subtracting Values: ", number, total
	
	divide total by number
	number = number / 2
	print "After Divide Values: ", number, total
	
	multiply total by number
	number = number * 5
	print "After Multiply Values: ", number, total
End
